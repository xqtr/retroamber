A theme for RetroPie/Emulation station, in a 8bit/pixel style, using amber colors and much nostalgia. The theme is work in progress and i am building it, piece by piece. 

The images are in a 1:1 ratio, for smaller screens and devices with square screens, so they will seem a bit stretched in other screens, which are wider.

The theme, takes ideas and some elements from other themes that i really liked ( i mean the parts/elements ) and combine them in this theme, mostly to match and satisfy my requirements.

The elements i used from other themes are:

- Bottom bar from Carbon theme
- Selector, font, logos and consoles from Pixel theme
- Some text elements from Retro-CRT theme
- Sound, rating from SNES mini theme
- Image masks from TechDweebs theme

So, credits for the previous elements goes to the creators of them. 

## ToDo

- Add more images and systems
- Add an EmulationStation splash screen
- Add sounds on events
